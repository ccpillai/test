```{r set up, include=FALSE}
# This is our first code chunk. In the curly braces / chunk header above, 
# 'r' (which is automatically inserted) tells us that this is an R code chunk.
# We then named this chunk 'set up,' and specified that the contents of the chunk 
# shouldn't appear in the rendered file with the 'include = FALSE' argument.

# First, we load the packages that we'll be using. The packages have to 
# be installed before you load them, which you can do using install.packages().

library(Hmisc)      # for correlation matrix
library(psych)      # for descriptive statistics
library(knitr)      # for knitting to pdf
library(kableExtra) # for making pretty tables
library(ggpubr)     # for arranging plots
library(corrplot)   # for making correlogram
library(forcats)    # for reordering factor levels
library(tidyverse)  # for data wrangling

# You'll also want to check what your working directory is, so R knows where 
# to look for files. Try getwd() and setwd(). Alternatively, you can go to the
# top menu bar on your computer > Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory.

```{r clean data, include=FALSE}

# Next, we read in the .csv file. We included additional arguments in read_csv():
# (1) Set col_names as TRUE so the first row of the input will be used as the 
# column names, and will not be included in the data frame. (2) Specify that the 
# string "N/A" in the data should be interpreted as a missing value.

# read in T2 data
b2_data <- read_csv ("K2_T2_BehavioralData_20200728.csv") 
                    col_names =  TRUE 
                    na = "N/A"

# look at each column's class
#sapply(b2_data, class)

# you can do something like this to change the class of a specific column
#b2_data$k2_t2_b_grade_year <- as.factor(b2_data$k2_t2_b_grade_year)

# view your data frame
#View(b2_data)

# After checking that the data looks normal, we use pipes (%>%) for a series 
# of actions on our original data frame, b2_data. The cleaned result is 
# assigned to a new variable, b2_clean.

# look at existing column names
#colnames(b2_data)

# clean the data

  mutate(grade = fct_relevel(grade,
                             "K", "1", "2"))

# TO-DO: [Cha Cha] Continue to rename and select relevant columns in the code 
# above. Let's stick with these variables for now:
    # participant_id
    # k2_t2_b_age_years
    # k2_t2_b_age_months
    # k2_t2_b_age_days
    # k2_t2_b_grade_year
    # k2_t2_b_color_raw
    # k2_t2_b_lttr_raw
    # k2_t2_b_elision_raw
    # k2_t2_b_swe_raw_fin
    # k2_t2_b_pde_raw_fin
    # k2_t2_b_swe_agescal
    # k2_t2_b_pde_agescal
    # k2_t2_b_swe_grdscal
    # k2_t2_b_pde_grdscal
    # k2_t2_b_wj_corr_nb

# Extra exercise: Try to create another data frame with just the participant id, age, 
# grade, and CTOPP Elision data. Try reordering the columns, like putting grade ahead
# of everything else.


# TO-DO: [During next meeting] Go over mutate and use it to make a new age variable
